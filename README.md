Kata Game of Life
=================

This repository contains a Kata for Coding Dojo named [Game of Life][kata-gameoflife].

* The focus of this approach is to use Hamcrest Matchers.
* The solution is developed via TDD with fixing the tests first right within the tests and
    slowly migrating the solution to production code.
